 Roadmap: a simple word and character counting tool created with Script Editor.

 Different Versions:

 - 2️⃣ There are two different versions of Roadmap. One is simply “Roadmap” which
 Acts as just a normal Word Count application.

 - 📖 There is also “Roadmap (Guided)” which adds two alerts letting you know
 What setup you need to preform and when the program is finished.

 - ⚠️ Each version of the program REQUIRES a Document to already be open in
 TextEdit; Otherwise the program will crash and hand out an error message.
