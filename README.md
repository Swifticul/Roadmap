 Roadmap: a simple Word-and-Character Count tool created in AppleScript

 —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— 

 Different Versions:

 There are two different versions of Roadmap. One is simply “Roadmap” which
 Acts as just a normal Word Count application.

 There is also “Roadmap (Guided)” which adds two alerts letting you know
 What setup you need to preform and when the program is finished.

 Each version of the program REQUIRES a Document to already be open in
 TextEdit; Otherwise the program will crash and hand out an error message
